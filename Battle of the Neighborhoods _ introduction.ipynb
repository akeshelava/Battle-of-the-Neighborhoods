    "This project will analyze neighborhoods between Vancouver, BC and Toronto, ON Canada. An IT startup company is looking to move its office from New York City to either Vancouver or Toronto. The company needs to determine which city better suits the living standards of its employees, and alongside with  office rentals it is considering the overall attractiveness of the  neighborhoods and local businesses in the cities.  In this project we will explore and compare the central neighborhoods in the two cities, and determine which neighborhoods best fit the living habits and culture of the IT companyâ€™s employees. The highest-rated by the employees is the easy access to various food places, gyms and parks, and this shall be taken into consideration when choosing the destination city. "
